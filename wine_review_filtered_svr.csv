2.0,"I would give one more star if it came clean on the bottle and called itself a 'sweet red'. Instead it get's poetic and grandiose about itself when all it is is a blend which (standard practice) gets a dash of grape juice concentrate to sweeten it. It also looses a star for the price, I rather look to the side of my Target's shelves and pick-up a Lambrusco for about 3-4 less.

5.0,"Based on positive reviews, I served all of the Fancy Pants varieties at a recent party. My guests and I loved them! Since I am not a wine expert, I will provide some details on this variety from the Fancy Pants website: ...is like sunshine in the glass. Its brisk and bright, with inviting citrus, melon and passion fruit aromas leading to mouthwatering grapefruit and zesty lime flavors with hints of minerality on the palate. Vibrant acidity and a crisp, clean finish make this wine a versatile partner for a wide range of foodsespecially succulent seafood, Mediterranean-style grilled vegetables, and salads. Served well chilled, our Sauvignon Blanc is fun and friendlythe perfect pour for sunny afternoons and picnics.

5.0,"This is a great buy for the price. Someone had given me a bottle and I liked the look of it so much that I didn't want to open it. Had no idea it was so nicely priced and so easily available. Finally opened it when I was in a bind, needing white wine for a favorite holiday recipe and this was all I had on hand. It's a nice, smooth Pinot, very nice flavor, pleasurable to the palate. What I especially love about this brand, however, is the bottle itself! Screw off the black top and there is a smaller neck with a cork closure. The beauty is that the black cap is designed so that it will reseal the bottle without the cork needing to be squeezed back in...a really thoughtful design. I almost hate to admit how much I was impressed by it! Will be stopping by Target specifically to buy more to have in the house. Highly recommend.

Also, due to this specific brew - you can probably expect your box to smell as absolutely jaw droppingly amazing as mine. Spice, malts, sweetness. Ughhhh. I keep opening and closing the box and sniffing the bags so much that my girlfriend is getting annoyed.The actual product itself is quite comprehensive - best kit I've purchased thus far. It comes with stickers for your bottle caps, (great idea guys!), was comparatively priced against competitors beers, a large bag of liquid malt, a smaller bag of dry malt, a can of pumpkin pie mix (debating tossing in another can on my own), brown sugar, a long vanilla bean stalk with a pouch of cinnamon, bittering hops, cheesecloth, priming sugar and dry yeast.

4.0,"Virgils Natural Micro Brewed Rootbeer Soda, 12 Ounce -- 24 per case, from Virgils Rootbeer.I have mixed feelings about Virgil's Rootbeer. To start with, the root and bark of the Sassafras tree are no longer used, as they cause cancer and liver damage. The Sarsaparilla vine used to be used, but nowadays, most root beers use an artificial sarsaparilla flavor. Virgil's is naturally brewed from Sweet Birch, and a lot of other natural flavors. The licorice does not improve it, it contains too much sugar, and it is packaged in a breakable glass bottle. Processed food makers in general use far too much sugar and salt than is good for us.

Once I discovered Dirty Sue, not only did it fix these problems, but it allows me to offer my guests a much higher quality of olive juice. Let's face it, if a patron is going to order a high end gin or vodka martini, why would they want a sub par ingredient mixed with it Why couldn't I have thought of this!",this product is great i am a general manager at an upscale restaurant in hollywood ca and i was tired of having my bartenders taking the time to drain the brine out of jars of olives its a huge waste of time and the olives when separated from the brine dry out almost immediately once i discovered dirty sue not only did it fix these problems but it allows me to offer my guests a much higher quality of olive juice lets face it if a patron is going to order a high end gin or vodka martini why would they want a sub par ingredient mixed with it why couldnt i have thought of this,1

By being able to create a unique product that is made with all natural ingredients and pure cane sugar you get a smooth, well balanced cocktail that doesn't have any artificial flavors or aftertaste.

Mix tequila with CA Manhattan mix and our premium lime juice for a fine Margarita. Or make a Dark and Stormy using lite rum, CA Manhattan Mix, CA Mule Mix and top with club soda. Another favorite of mine is the Nigroni with Gin, CA Manhattan Mix, Campari and an orange twist. I urge you guys to exparament and see what you can create.

The big circle washer does an OK job, but the turbo washer really gets it done (see photo). The big circle washer would be good for maintaining, not for a deep clean.

5.0,"Do you love margaritas They are among the most popular adult beverages in America and many people rank them as their favorite alcoholic beverage of all. The right tequila can make a noticeable difference when mixing up a margarita, but the right mixer is important as well. And one of the best mixers available is Power Mahoney Margarita.I just got to know Powell Mahoney recently and I have been singing its praises ever since. This mix is every bit as delicious as the others in the Powell Mahoney lineup thanks in no small part to the all- natural ingredients used in the process. Have you taken a good look at the ingredients used in other mixers They're enough to make even the most tolerant person cringe. Even a really good tequila often cannot mask the taste of a bad mixer and I can think of many mixed drinks that I could barely finish due to a less-than-pleasant mixer base.With Powell Mahnoey Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural taste you desire with a good balance between the sweet and the sour. Pour a little into a glass and taste it all by itself. You will notice flavors of lime and a little bit of orange with an overall taste that leans toward the sour side but one that seems just right to match with a fine tequila. The taste is even good enough that some people might enjoy this mixer served with non- alcoholic combinations like soda water and even on the rocks with nothing added.Margaritas are popular drinks but even your favorite drink can lose its appeal if it contains a weak ingredient. With Powell Mahoney Margarita mixer, you get the great, natural, fresh citrus flavor that makes for the perfect mixed drink. Buy a bottle from this Vermont- based company and fall in love with your margarita, all over again.

4.0,"The 'Burlesque' has a distinctive central flavor - I think it's walnut husk, aromatic and bitter in itself, and easy to pair with warm flavors. I like that taste, having done some experiments based on the Parsons book, and find it uncommon among the commercial bitters I've tried.But, I have to say, I still prefer my own walnut-based flavors. This comes on strong with the central flavor and enticing bitterness, but lacks the secondary and tertiary notes that make a flavor memorable. So, it's good. If I didn't make my own, very good - it would be a regular on my shelf. Recommended, unless you make your own.-- wiredweirdPS: I'm not a fan of dropper bottles, and this comes with a medicine dropper. Perhaps you get more repeatability and precision with a dropper, until the bottle runs low, but I prefer the convenience of a shaker, which you can find easily at Amazon.

1.0,"Actually, the Great Value crescent rolls in my area's Walmarts come in a white package with black and blue writing ... plus a picture of a couple beautiful crescent rolls. Nonetheless, I expect my experience with this brand and product is applicable. I bought 2 dozen of the various types -- flaky butter, reduced fat, and standard -- and all had the same problems to some degree. Although I was using the rolls up to 3 weeks prior to the 30JUN13 expiration date on the end-cap of the packages, the dough in many packages was so dry (old poorly stored) that it would stick to the packaging. And it was impossible to unroll the dough.. I had to pry off chunks ... and then try to put the chunks together like a jigsaw puzzle into some Frankenrolls. The other reviews say the SAME THING ... going back as far as 2009. And now I'm extending that same complaint to mid-2013.

1.0,"If I could give these crescent rolls less that a full star rating, I would! I would even give it a negative star. Of course, whenever you buy any pre made dough in a pop can, you expect a POP! Well, nothing happenedat first. I had to bang it on the counter to open, and when it did, it was more of a BANG than a pop, and dough shot out all over the place. The dough that was salvageable, in no way resembled a crescent. I had to form it into triangles by myself, of course the dough was so sticky that it was nearly impossible. The taste of the finished rolls did however taste the same as name brand rolls, but the measly few cents saved to purchase the great value brand was not worth the extra work, and mess to purchase.

I like my margaritas on the rocks and this mix seems to really do the trick as far as flavor. The reason I had even picked up a bottle to try is because the local golf course uses this to mix their margaritas and so I thought it would be a good start for me. I didnt have to search long to find it and I actually paid a decent price for it. The container is easy to pour out of and is sturdy. I use Jose Cuervo to mix my margaritas, although I think any tequila would work. I dont shake mine yet because I still need to buy a shaker but I do give them a good mix. The overall taste of the mix is sweet and tart, but not overly powerful on those to senses. I recently mowed my lawn and had a cocktail as I did so, and the mix was just the right flavor to enjoy a nice summer day. I will definitely be purchasing more of this mix in the near future and maybe adding different fruit flavors to it to punch it up a notch, but dont get me wrong the flavor out of the bottle is very good.

I add it to my fruit smoothies and gives them just that touch of sweetness and coconut flavoring to make them pop. Right now I am using it with an orange chicken stir fry. My problem is that I have been looking for it for about a month and cannot find it at the Walmart stores where I bought it originally. While this is a great product I really don't want to buy a case of it. However, if that is the only way I can get it I may have no other choice. Please start stocking this in the stores.

5.0,"I was searching for coconut syrup at my Walmart one day, and I found this Coco Real in the mixed drinks section. While I don't drink alcoholic drinks, I do enjoy mocktails occasionally, so I figured if it wouldn't work for pancakes, then I could make Pina/Colada Mocktails out of it and some pineapple juice. I shook the bottle good to make sure everything was mixed well, then used it on my hot pancakes at home. It was sooooo good. I usually only use pure maple syrup on them, but wanted some coconut syrup. This really filled that need so well. It was so delicious that I do believe I wouldn't even need to use butter on my pancakes when I use Coco Real as my syrup. It's not been easy to find locally for some reason, not even at the Walmart where I found it once. I bought the last two bottles Walmart had that day. It would be very nice if Walmart.com would make it available by the bottle without having to purchase an entire case at one time. I used one of those two bottles up pretty fast, but since I can't find it anymore, I am saving my remaining bottle for when I will get a real bad craving for coconut syrup. Torani also makes a good sugar-free coconut syrup that I would like for Walmart.com to keep in stock regularly, as well as their sugar-free Watermelon syrup. In the hot summertime, Torani sugar-free Watermelon syrup makes such refreshing drinks, and it goes well with Mexican food, which I really enjoy. It's the next best thing to liquefying cubes of real watermelon in my blender and chilled.

5.0,"I usually always buy Carmex when it comes to lip balm and the original jar is one of my go-to Carmex products.

5.0,"My lips are almost ALWAYS chapped without Carmex. I've had dry and chapped lips for so long and I've tried everything: Blistex, EOS, Chapsticks, Lucas' PawPaw and even medicated lip ointments. I recently picked up a Carmex over an 'instinctual urge' and I don't think I've ever looked back since. Carmex does wonders for my lips. They're so smooth and soft now - even my boyfriend has commented on them! The consistency is just right, not too thin and not too thick. I've found with Lucas' Pawpaw, it's only good for chapped lips and Blistex and EOS only gives me a thin layer of lip balm. I like to apply lip balm before I sleep because my room sits at a cool 11 degrees celsius. I find that because of the consistency, Carmex really absorbs and heals your lips while you sleep. Blistex leaves a thin coating on my lips when I wake up whilst pawpaw doesn't absorb very well either and sometimes dries out my lips even more. I recommend this little tub of goodness to everyone and anyone who is looking for a great lip balm or lip remedy. I've only needed to apply it 3-4 times daily, and I have extremely dry and chapped lips from my medication and it works wonders for me.

5.0,"I'm from a generation of Wisconsin families who have had Carmex Original Lip Balm Jars faithfully in their pocket, purse, backpack, and bathroom for over 40 years. From harsh winter weather to scorching summer sun, along with dry lips and a few cold sores thrown in between, Carmex has relieved it all. From the first sight of the jar wanting to be opened, to that unique sound of the tiny lid being screwed off with a pleasant aroma that greets you, and finally to the tingly lip sensation after application...it's happiness to my senses!

I know that sounds shallow, but it's the truth. I felt immediate results and my fever blisters healed quickly and the Carmex soothed them. Needless to say, I have jars and tubes of Carmex every where in my house, car, purses, etc. You can never have enough. I use it multiple times a day and my lips are so smooth and protected.

It's actually the only lipcare that I use--also perfect as a base before I put on lipstick. It just absolutely works. That's it. A lot of other brands work for an hour or few, but with Carmex your lips stay moisturized well, and helps to prevent cold sores, although I don't get them, it's nice to know that it also will care for them.

4.0,"I have tried the Cabernet and the Merlot. When I received these I followed the suggestion of letting the wine sit from shipping, and then to open and let sit in order to breathe. I felt the Cabernet was still to young, it had a very strong bite to it. I don't consider myself an expert, but I know a wine I like and have been taught a lot and am still learning. The Merlot on the other hand was much better! It was smooth and had a deep fruit flavor with mild tannins. I would continue buying this one. I have not tried the Pinot Noir yet. I'm hoping this will be just as satisfying as the Merlot was. I will add to my review once I've opened the bottle.

2.0,"I almost cant believe all of the good reviews for these wines. We pretty much couldn't even drink them because they are so sweet, thick and jammy. Like fruit juice. We started with the Pinot Noir and after a few sips, aerating and then a few more sips with dinner, we just poured it out. It did not resemble any Pinot I've had before. So we moved on to the Cabernet - and it was almost the same thing. I haven't tried the Merlot yet but not looking forward to it. If I had bought these at a local shop they would be returned. Unfortunately, I that's not an option since they are open and mail order. Maybe the rest can be frozen for cooking.

The funny thing is, we aren't even Chardonnay drinkers! We both thought that one was the only consumable wine. Still bad but the best of the whole lot of wines. Rose was the next best but very tart, pulling slightly sour and not in a good way. Both the Pinot & Cab Sauv were very sour, almost like corked wine tastes. It burned when you drank it, like you were drinking straight rubbing alcohol. Gross! We brought them to the correct temp, let them breathe, etc... but they are just straight up nasty. Was a big disappointment as we were really looking forward to getting them and being on auto-delivery.

After trying each variety, I regret the decision. While not horrible, they aren’t good either. These aren’t wines I’d serve to anyone or drink again let alone purchase again. The rosé is a sweet wine no doubt about it, which isn’t my taste, but it was described as being not too sweet. The chardonnay is the strangest tasting chardonnay I’ve ever tasted. It was described as not being too oaky. I guess I like my chardonnay oaky. And the pinot noir, which the “wine expert” repeatedly mispronounced (RED FLAG) was just bland. The cabernet sauvingnon was supposed to be the best of the bunch and it was private reserve after all but just turned out to be disappointing as well. These wines were touted as having a retail value of $20-$25 per bottle but taste more like sub $10 per bottle, which is exactly how much it works out to when you buy the case.

5.0,"I was a little skeptical about purchasing wine from QVC, but I've been very surprised by the quality of this wine collection. I ordered the mixed-auto delivery package. The Moscato was indeed sweet (just like you'd expect from a Moscato), and the Syrah was not too bad. I guess I should have said from the outset that I'm a sweet-wine drinker (I like sweet red wines), so the Red was not to my liking because it was too dry. I never drink Chardonnay because they are likewise too dry for me. But, Kevin O'Leary's Chardonnay is my favorite from the entire order! It is awesome, magnificent, and very tasty! I even ordered some Fettuccine just so I could pair it with the Chardonnay. Great find (for me). I'm so glad I ordered the auto-delivery because I can't wait to see what I get in the Spring.

5.0,"I purchased two of these as holiday gifts. The price seemed just right for a bottle of wine, glasses and chocolate. In fact, even without glasses, this would've been a good value to ship across country. I was skeptical about how nicely the presentation would look in person but the recipients sent a picture and I was floored. It looks gorgeous. And expensive. I can't speak to the quality of the wine, but as far as the overall gift, I am pleased that the recipients are pleased and would purchase again. However, as another reviewer noted and that I did not read before purchasing, there was some risqu little cards included in the gift box that boldly stated let's get naked referring I'm sure to the name of the winery. And also I truly did not even notice the silhouettes of women on the glasses or the tag line we aim to tease on the glasses, which is my fault, but I have to say I did not like that. I feel a bit embarrassed now as I hope the recipients don't confuse my intentions. Fortunately these gifts went to couples with a sense of humor about it but had I sent this to someone more conservative in my life, I would have been so very, very embarrassed.

1.0,I purchased these to give as gifts last year and when I tried the wine myself I spit it out and was mortified.I was so embarrassed that I gave these wines to people I know that I had to apologize and give another gift.This is by far some of the worst swill I���ve ever had.There are wines that are the same price from California wineries that are far superior.I would not even cook with this stuff.I wish I had discovered the poor quality and the offensive taste during the return period because they would have gone back. This is what they had in mind when they coined the expression ���rot gut���.
