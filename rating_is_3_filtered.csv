This wine has a wonderful but strong aroma its a bit bitter has a bite to it but still goodit was worth it in the end Simply Wonderful
"I like the wine and I like the idea of a sealed cube during the week when only drinking a glass or two at a time. But when they re-sized the box a few months ago, it made it impossible to open and setup properly. While I applaud Target for reducing the packaging, this just isn't working. Wine Is Good - The Cube Is Not"
Decent table wine for the price. Bend that is on the sweeter side of the spectrum. pretty good
We buy this bottle every week but the only thing we do not like is that every time you take the top off it leaves a black residue in the drink and a gross smell on your hand from twisting the top off ! If you guys could fix that then it would be twice more amazing I Would Buy This Drink Again And Again If
Wanted Watkins Products root beer extract but it seems it is no longer available. This brand is all right but do not like the caramel color additive. Watkins is clear Root Beer Flavor
AMAZING PRODUCT! SOBER FOR 6 YEARS AND BOY DOES THIS DO IT FOR ME! A PINT A DAY KEEPS THE DOCTOR AWAY! I DRINK IT STRAIGHT
"I simply love Clamato - its simply delicious. However, the sodium content is so high that I do not drink it at all anymore. If a low sodium version was made it would be the only product of this nature I would purchase. Sodium content"
The mix inside the container smells very similar to kool aid. It is a good sugary drink mix when access to a blender or the time to make a homemade product is unavailable. It's decent for the price though my guest seemed to like it. A word of caution before pouring anything into the bucket carefully inspect the bottom of the bucket and spout for damage. On one of these my bucket was uknowlingly damaged and I lost a substantial amount as my margarita dripped out into the freezer. - Cheers It is what it it is
The taste is awesome. Drink
"I bought two of these kits to make ten gallons. After 3 weeks in the 2- 5 gallon primary's I kegged 5 gallons. The instructions for the vodka, spices and vanilla bean slurry were vague as to when to make the potion and how to store it. I mixed mine on brew day and it sat in the fridge while the beer fermented. It turned into a snot ball. I sanitized a mason jar and took half the ten gallons worth of potion mixture and while I kegged I added some beer to the jar and shook it vigorously to break up the snot ball. It worked for the most part. The first 3 beers came out a bit chunky but it cleared up. The potion made the beer taste a bit like cider. It's got a very upfront pumkin spice kick with hints of cinnamon. I'm not a big fan of these prominent flavors so I bottled the second 5 gallons without the potion.Overall the kits good. The abv came out at about 6.9 after adding an extra pound of dextrose.I expect he bottles to be a bit more to my liking. Nice kit, but..."
This is an extract kit. I don't recall seeing that anywhere in the description. Good beer though. Good beer though
"I have had better strips. When I opened package found them slightly stale... Sure enough check the expire date Oct 2015. Well shoot, bought in Oct. I should have known better. Used them in soup and tossed the rest. Ok, not great."
It's a bit sweet but blends up well. Margaritas
"They barely have a hint of buffalo flavor. If you like your wings to taste of nothing but pepper than these are for you. They have plenty of flavor to them just not what your expecting for buffalo flavor. Now the wings themselves are not bad. They are decently meaty. Maybe a little to heavy on the breading, but not to bad though. The sizes of the wings vary greatly but not really a big deal. I'd by them again if they change the flavoring, but i'd say just stick to the plain and get your own sauce. To much black pepper!"
"These Great Value Buffalo Style Boneless Wyngz are extremely hot. If you like spicy, hot, flavors in your food then these are for you. I thought they cooked up well, but I just did not care for the spicy hotness of them. HOT, HOT, HOT!!"
This product seems to help my liver if I take it before eating. 
"I really like this product - it's the best out there. However, the combination of the occasional bad (mold) bottle, and the glass breakage/leaking, for the price point it's not worth the hassle. If I can buy it locally I will, otherwise I have to give up on Dirty Sue :-( Best product I won't buy online again"
It's a little too dirty but we used the whole bottle in a couple of weeks. If you really like 'em dirty...
"I like the Modern Cocktail packs, but was a little misled by the description for this one on Amazon.Possibly not the manufacturer's fault - their package description is spot on.On Amazon it says something like 'add gin or vodka for Martinis and other similar drinks.'But this one is all formulated for Tequila - all the drinks are Margaritas or other tequila drinks.Instead of the sugar that comes with the other drinks, this one comes with salt.I am not saying it's bad - for 0 calories, obviously they couldn't use sugar. but i just assumed they would be just like the other mixes but made with nutrisweet or something.As long as you know what to expect - a much less sweet drink that goes better with tequila salt - then they are fine. of course, you can put whatever liquor you want in there, but i tried one with vodka and it just tasted odd to me.Here is exactly what the drinks are: Mango Skinny Margarita, Blood Orange Tequila Sunrise, Classic Skinny Margarita, Strawberry Tequila Lemonade, Acai Blueberry Skinny Margarita. Not sweet, not martinis--salty Tequila/Margaritas"
"Cobblestone English Muffins, Wheat, 6ct. Are they 'spose to be SO Doughy Hard to slice 'cuz the doughy inside balls-up. Taste very good, (only after toasting till the edges burn) should it be"
"Very poor packaging, wrapping and shipping. Two of three bottles were broke on arrival . Great product , , two of three broke"
"First off its not as powerful as the gas model I had but its not as bad as the other reviews describe. My gas model would peel paint. This one is not that strong. If you need something to wash and clean, it works fine on concrete and dirt. If you need to peel paint, get a gas one. Not bad"
I bought this article on sale and was a good deal it doesn't has a lot of power but works. Good price
"It was just ok, I will buy it only if you guys run out of your Great Value Diet Tonic Water. (Because I have to have the diet) Schweppes just doesn't have the flavor nor does it it hold its carbonation like the Great Value Brand does. Schweppes Diet Tonic water"
"Very smooth, but very sweet. I would like to know how much sugar is added... Sweet and smooth."
"I didn't like this product when compared to Master of Mixes Lite. Jose Cuervo seemed flat with little or no tartness, and tasted artificial. Don't believe it contains any real lime juice. Flat Artificial"
"This is extremely spicy with ginger. Not so much gingerbread flavor, as I hoped for.I'm thinking of blending it with other bitters to achieve more of a gingerbread flavor. Super Spicy bitters."
"These sounded better than they ended up being. I found them to be a little too bitter and tart for an Old Fashioned. Now I love cranberries, and understand how tart real ones are...but in a drink I do not really want to be a purist, I want great taste. I will try adding a bit more sugar to my drink, but I doubt it will make mush of an impact. Bottom line is, OK, but not great. These sounded better than they ended up being"
Only knock is for the actual taste which is not quite orange cream but a vanilla-vinegar orange rhine sort of taste. Depends on what you're going for in taste profile as I can see this easily matching some others' preferences for mixed drinks. Good based on your tastes
It's ok. Three Stars
"This doesnt put out the heat I wanted. To get a good bite you add so much it effects the flavor of the drink.It's not terrible. But a chopped jalapeo can get just as much if not more heat , with a better flavor. Not as hot as I wanted."
"Good product selection, priced right, had delivery issues "
I love Mango everything! I don't like pure sugar! This is so very thick sweet even if I try it in a frozen Margarita. I am sticking with the citrus one. A little too thick sweet
A little thick but taste great!! Mom
"Very smooth, but very sweet. I would like to know how much sugar is added... Sweet and smooth."
Pretty good for a quickie Drink mix
"This chalk is nice and sturdy, even for a rowdy 2 year old! For the grandkids..."
"I haven't tried the product yet. I bought these as part of some end of year gifts we are doing for our teachers. I'm planning on setting them out and teachers can choose the one that they want. I didn't realize that each bottle is not individually labeled. Instead, the labeling of the flavor and directions for mixing are on the outside of the box. Now, I have to make labels for each bottle before I give them out... I haven't tried the product yet. I bought these ..."
"The crescent rolls taste good , but the last couple of times i purchased them they were so smashed together i had to build crescent rolls out of the pieces that i could separate. crescent pieces"
"We don't like this brand as good as the Dailey's Brand, but it will do. We can't find the Dailey's anywhere, so we settled for this. We don't use it for alcohol, we use it to make smoothies with. It will do"
Use it on occasion works fine. Keeps lips from getting too dry. Good for chapped lips
Use this while skiing and it protects from chapping and cracking Works well
"I like using carmex, but then I felt I was getting addicted to it cool tin"
It's the familiar classic standard - and it's effective. But I'm glad there are more variations available too! Old reliable
I like carmex but this design is awkward if you put it in your pocket. Have to keep my finger clean when using. Not very functional Good product
I dont buy much this product because I have to use my fingers and they are not always clean hard to use
Bought this recently and did the temporary job although I feel like its a bit messy having to wipe the finger off afterward and only a temp lip fix Classic Jar Carmex
"Although I like the jar a lot, it is hard to get it to my lips without greasing up my fingers. It also seems like it could manifest germs Jar makes it harder"
I have used this as far back as I can remember .. I love carmax however just recent my lips have become very sensitive to carmax .. If I could I would continue to use it Ok
"I have tried all of the carmex products...this is my least favorite....although it is very moisturizing, i cant stand the smell or taste on my lips...if they would make it as awesome as the strawberry flavored stick it would be much better. NOT my favorite of the bunch"
Nearly 40. Been using this for years on lips and cuticles. I wish the packaging didn't change. The inverted bottom isn't right. Wish there was a vegan version was available. How is the lanolin derived for this product My favorite before all the changes. Great product. Stop changing!
"I've used the Carmex Original in the Lip Balm Jar for as long as I can remember, ever since someone introduced it to me either in late elemtary or middle school. So many many memories are associated with this simple little product that has grown up with me for 34+ years! I love how it's never really changed except for some minor changes to the jar during those years until now these genius additions to the line that has only made it better.thank you Carmex for being there being such an important part of my ever changing life! The Original is a Classic a Staple in My Life"
always use this and it works a treat however there is a massive dent built in the bottom of the classic jar which makes it look like you are getting more for your money. The squeezie tube is better value for money - same price with more product Great Stuff shame about misleading packaging
"When I bought the new carmex that's in a pkg, rather than how they used to sell it in an open box..I noticed that it went up in price. Not a big deal, since that happens with time, everything seems to go up. But what I was upset about was that, even though it looks like the same jar, if you look underneath, the indentation goes up so far, that it is about half of what you used to get. I have an old glass jar, and compared to the new plastic one, the indentation on the bottom is at least half way up! Now I've noticed the ones that are not in pkgs, have a tight plastic sticker on the bottom to cover up that fact. I haven't bought any carmex since. I was going to email the company, but they sent me an email to review their product. Not the same as the original..."
"Great Product better then Abreva, price is fair better then most products Product is Wonderful"
keeps lips moist for a long while but could be better moist
"This is good, it works well and it has a nice sent Great"
A good Chorizo should color your cooking oil red when fried in a pan. This Chorizo does not. Don Quijote is much better but more expensive and getting harder to find. What a shame that we cannot buy a good Chorizo here in the United States anymore. Does not color oil red
"This is a good cooking wine unless you want to save it in the refrigerator. In a few days, it loses its taste.Have bought an eight pack of white grape juice to have on hand instead of getting this again. This is a good cooking wine unless you want to save it in ..."
This ointment works fine for dry eye. My only downfall is that it has a metal tip applicator. If it were plastic like the other similar products then I would give it 5 stars. Alright But....
"This wine is not great, in my opinion. I know wine taste is subjective, and this is only my opinion. But to me the wines are harsh, not smooth. An $8 taste, not $20 like hosts claimed. I'll drink it, will not gift it as I had hoped to, and have cancelled my auto delivery. I bought the mixed box so I've tried them all... Worth Exactly What I Paid..."
"Got this for the nice variety it offered. Rose is nice, not too sweet not too dry. Pinot noir is average, nothing special or outstanding and I wouldn’t get it again. Chardonnay is awful— maybe just the bottle we opened, but it immediately smelled spoiled and tasted the same. Wound up pouring it down the drain and hoping the next two bottles aren’t rotten as well. Have not tried the Cab yet as it’s my favorite type of wine and I hate to be disappointed—hoping we’ll be two for four at least. Sorry to say next time I’ll pass... Disappointed"

"Not the quality at all that I was expecting from Kevin O'Leary. Very disappointed, and I would not serve this to guests. Mediocre at best!"
"I was really hopeful that I would experience a new tasting wine just because it's ""Mr. Wonderful's"" brand. However it was not as flavorful as what I had become accustomed. It's not bad it's just okay. I purchased the Zinfandel. I wanted the Moscato but it had sold out. I still may go back later and purchase it because it might be exactly what I'm looking to purchase. I would still recommend this product because everyone has a different expectation when it comes to wine tasting. I EXPECTED MORE FLAVOR"
